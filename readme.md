## 🏰 Gakhars Lineage & Legacy — Ancestral Timeline Project

**Live Demo**: [gakhars.mdkvaofficial.com](https://gakhars.mdkvaofficial.com)

A visual, interactive timeline tracing the **historical lineage, cultural identity, and geographic journey** of the **Gakhar–Kayani tribe** — built as a digital heritage project to preserve and present centuries of human history in one connected view.

---

## 📚 Purpose

I built this project to digitally preserve and visualize the rich lineage of the **Gakhars and Kayanis**, a warrior tribe deeply rooted in South Asian history. The idea was to create something that bridges **faith, genealogy, and historical context**, especially for younger generations who may be unfamiliar with their ancestral background.

It’s an attempt to connect personal roots with **global timelines** — through a clean, interactive interface that respects tradition while embracing modern digital storytelling.
